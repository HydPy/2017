  title: "Workshop I - Embedded Linux Device Interfacing with Python"
  description: "The objective of the workshop is to understand how various sensors and actuators are accessed and controlled from a Linux based embedded system.<br/>
                This will be a starting point for people who want to build connected and IoT enabled embedded systems using Linux.<br/><br/>
                Embedded Systems are no longer restricted to firmware developers. With Linux being used in many embedded systems, Java and Python developers can also build useful products using these systems.<br/>
                This workshop will help application developers learn how to interface with the sensors and actuators using interfaces like Serial, I2C, GPIO, PWM and ADC, from a high level language like Python.<br/>"
