  title: "Workshop I - Embedded Linux Device Interfacing with Python"
  description: "The objective of the workshop is to understand how various sensors and actuators are accessed and controlled from a Linux based embedded system.<br/>
                This will be a starting point for people who want to build connected and IoT enabled embedded systems using Linux.<br/><br/>
                Embedded Systems are no longer restricted to firmware developers. With Linux being used in many embedded systems, Java and Python developers can also build useful products using these systems.<br/>
                This workshop will help application developers learn how to interface with the sensors and actuators using interfaces like Serial, I2C, GPIO, PWM and ADC, from a high level language like Python.<br/>"

  title: "My Journey to RDO Community"
  description: "Contributing to an Open Source project not only helps you to get a better job, also helps to learn lots of skills, technology, communication and knowing people across the globe. But start contributing to Open Source appears to be hard as it requires an effort to make a contribution.<br/>
                Everyone possess some skills but we need some guidance to getting started as it is not so hard. It just requires being getting started, always stay contributing, once you feel mature, you need to stick to any community. Patience and Time plays an important role in shaping your future in this world.<br/>
                I will be sharing my journey to opensource how I had started as a open source translator to open source developer for RDO community.<br/><br/>
                The talk will highlight:<br/>
                * What is contribution and why should I contribute?<br/>
                * How have I started contributing while I was in college.<br/>
                * Follow the master to become the master.<br/>
                * Frustration, burnout while contributing to Open Source and how to overcome it.<br/>
                * Knowing the community and stay motivated.<br/>
                * How I got involved with RDO community.<br/>
                * Reached a goal and what next?"

  title: "The Journey to Jarvis v2.0 via Stephanie: Building your very own simple AI"
  description: "Ever wanted a personal assistant like Jarvis for yourself? Fear not. <a href='http://slapbot.github.io'>Stephanie</a> addresses the problem by providing an open-source platform built specifically for voice-controlled applications as well as to automate daily tasks and hence imitating much of a virtual/personal assistant’s job.<br/>
                The objective of the talk will be to give first hand experience of teaching people on how to create their own simple AI with Stephanie with just a couple of clicks after downloading the files and then providing a tutorial on how to create their own modules so that they could harness the true ability of virtual assistant."

  title: "Neural Networks from zero (using only numpy) to practical projects (using scikit-learn and TensorFlow)"
  description: "Artificial Neural Networks (ANN henceforth) are being used increasingly ever in recent years, and some consider it as a master key for almost all machine learning problems. There are many toolkits and libraries (tools henceforth) available, but I myself have never been comfortable with such tools until I understand (at least partially) what’s going on under the hood. I’m in no way saying that these tools are poorly documented or have a difficult learning curve, it’s just the way I tend to learn. Assuming that I am not alone in this regard, I would like to help others in their quest to understand and master ANN by giving my bit."
